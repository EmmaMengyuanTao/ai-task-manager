## Project Description

AI Task Manager is an AI-powered project management web application designed to improve collaboration and productivity in student group assignments.

One common challenge in student teams is the absence of a designated leader, often resulting in disorganized task management, unclear responsibilities, and uneven workload distribution. AI Task Manager tackles this issue by analyzing project requirements alongside team members' skills to automatically suggest task breakdowns and fair assignments.

By streamlining workflows and ensuring equitable task distribution, the application allows teams to operate efficiently without relying on a formal leader. This boosts overall productivity, reduces conflicts, and helps students focus on delivering high-quality work.

## Starter code

daveyplate's [better-auth-nextjs-starter](https://github.com/daveyplate/better-auth-nextjs-starter) repository.

## Setup

We use docker to run the postgres db:

### Docker

You can use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for this — scroll down past the "Choose plan" section. If you're on a Mac, you can also use [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/). On Linux, you could use [Podman](https://podman.io/) with or without [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/).

All of these tools behave like docker, so you can (for our purposes) use them interchangeably.

Run the following command to try if Docker is working:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This will download ("pull") a hello-world image and execute it. You should see a message saying "Hello from Docker! This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly."

### Dependencies

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

### Hono

Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### DB — drizzle commands

Generate SQL files (migrations) from the drizzle schema:
```bash
pnpm db:generate
```

These files are generated in the `src/db/migrations` directory. Take a look at them to see what they contain, then you can apply them to the database.

Run the migrations, i.e. apply the generated SQL files to the database:
```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

To check if the migrations were applied successfully, you can start Drizzle Studio, a GUI for the database:
```bash
pnpm db:studio
```

### DB — docker commands

The postgres image is already defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
To start the docker container with the postgres image:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Stop the docker container and remove the volume:
Careful: this will delete the database and all data in it.
```bash
docker compose down --volumes
```
Omit the `--volumes` flag if you don't want to delete the volume.


You could run these directly, or use the script shortcuts defined in the `package.json` file:

```bash
pnpm db:start  # docker compose up
pnpm db:stop   # docker compose down
pnpm db:delete # docker compose down --volumes
```
